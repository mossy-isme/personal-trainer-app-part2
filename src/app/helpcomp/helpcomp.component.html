    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>
      Our application values user privacy. We collect only the necessary data to ensure a smooth
      and secure experience. Users can view, update, or delete their personal information
      at any time. We are committed to transparent data practices and provide clear information
      about how data is collected and used.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not store sensitive data, such as passwords, in plaintext and ensure that all
      user information is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
      Security is a core principle of our application. All communication between the client and
      server is encrypted using HTTPS. Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms are
      in place to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure safe handling of user inputs, we validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent
      security vulnerabilities like injection attacks. Additionally, we regularly update our
      dependencies and perform security audits to maintain the highest security standards.
